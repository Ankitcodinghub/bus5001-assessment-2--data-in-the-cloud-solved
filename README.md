<h1>Q1. Strategise and manage your cloud usage (5 Marks)</h1>
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) defines five essential characteristics of cloud computing. List these five characteristics. Choose the characteristic that best supports the Pay As You Go (PAYG) cost model and explain how it facilitates this billing approach using a practical example from a real-world cloud computing scenario.

Using an Azure subscription that you have made use of, provide an analysis of where and how costs on your subscription have been expended.

Based on this, retrospect and discuss best practices and strategies of how best you would monitor, optimise and manage your costs in the future.

<h1>Q2. Build a big data processing pipeline (8 Marks)</h1>
You are a data analytics professional supporting a local photography competition. During the competition photographs submitted will be uploaded to a cloud storage container in the cloud, you are tasked with making an automated data pipeline which will periodically scan all images uploaded using AI based cloud services and extract meta data about the photographs submitted to a database which can be viewed by the judges and the organisers.

Build a cloud-based pipeline using components from Microsoft Azure and Databricks with a complementing Visual Dashboard in Power BI.

<ol>
<li>Provide a narrative with screenshots to highlight your proposed solution, the components involved and how it works. Also note any other considerations that you have in terms of the pros and cons of your approach. (4 Marks)</li>
<li>Discuss 3 insights that you can derive from the dashboard, use with appropriate visuals to reinforce your insights. (4 Marks)</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

<h1>Q3. Restore and query an SQL database on the cloud (10 Marks)</h1>
You are a cloud consultant at Equinox Group, Northwind is one of the group’s recently acquired subsidiaries. Northwind’s main operational database, has recently experienced a critical failure, and the most recent backup is a “.bacpac” file which is available on a Github repository. Some urgent business queries have arisen that require immediate attention and you have been tasked with supporting the management of Northwind. The tasks are as follows;

<ol>
<li>Restore the database from the given backup and provide the answers to the following management questions.</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

<ol>
<li>What is the catalogue of all products along with their categories and unit price? ii. What were the top performing product categories by the total revenue generated? iii. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who were the top performing employees by the number of orders handled?</li>
</ol>
For each question provide the query, a screenshot of the resultant table and your insights. Feel free to suggest additional queries which will support your answers. (6 Marks)

<ol>
<li>How would you automate the restoration process to ensure business continuity in future incidents. (4 Marks)</li>
</ol>
<h1>Q4. Conduct an exploratory analysis of the NYC Taxi Limousine Commission dataset using Databricks (15 Marks)</h1>
For the period of data allocated (it will be a single year) to you on the New York City Taxi &amp; Limousine Commission dataset on Azure Databrick pick two contiguous months to answer the questions below;

<ol>
<li>Plot a visual to show how total fare generated by taxi trips with 3 or less passengers have changed over the course of the 2 contiguous months you have chosen by day. What insights can you derive from this visualisation? (5 marks)</li>
<li>What insights can you derive about the busiest and slowest period, from the perspective of the;</li>
</ol>
(30% of the mark)

<ol>
<li>days of the week</li>
<li>hours of the day</li>
</ol>
Use appropriate visuals to reinforce your analysis. (5 marks)

<ol>
<li>What are the top 10 routes by total income generated? (Consider that route is made up of a source and a destination taxi zone). Use a visualisation that effectively portrays this. (5 marks)</li>
</ol>
For each of the questions above as appropriate use

<ul>
<li>Screenshot of the visuals</li>
<li>Tables of the values</li>
<li>And the code that you used in your analysis</li>
</ul>
You will make use of an Azure Databrick cluster the details of which will be provided on the LMS under the section Assignment 2. The year allocated to you for analysis will also be shared with you on the LMS.

<strong>&nbsp;</strong>

<h1>DELIVERABLES</h1>
<ul>
<li>A professionally written report with the answer scripts to the 3 tasks.</li>
<li>The report should be submitted as a pdf, font size 11.</li>
<li>Report content should not exceed 8 – 10 pages (including diagrams).</li>
<li>The resulting PowerBI file as a shared document for Q2, best shared via One Drive.</li>
</ul>
